Install instructions
====================

*) Install a simple web server (nginx):
        sudo apt-get install nginx-common nginx-light

*) Build and install the arxiv-transform tools. From the source directory:
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ../
        make
        make install

*) Run the web server: (note: the path has to be absolute here)
        nginx -c /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/nginx.conf

   This command should be added to your list of commands to run at startup as well.

*) Then we need to setup the daily probe of the arXiv. If you leave your computer running during
   the whole week without turning it off, you will want to use a chron job. For example, open your
   cron table with:
        crontab -e

   Then add this line to the file to probe the arXiv every day at 7am:
        00 07 * * * /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/probe_arxiv_oai.sh /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform

   You can choose this update time yourself: you should choose a time that is a) before you
   usually arrive to work, and b) after the arXiv daily update to remain on top of the flow...

   If you shutdown your computer every day, then you can instead simply add the command to your
   list of startup programs:
        /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/probe_arxiv_oai.sh /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform

   It does not matter if this command is executed before or after the web server is started.

*) To continue we need a first probe of the arXiv to work with.
   Run the script manually (just this one time):
        /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/probe_arxiv_oai.sh /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform

*) Then open your favorite RSS reader and use the following RSS feed URL:
        http://localhost:8080/arxiv/rss/feed.rss

   If you are using Thunderbird, you need a "Blog and news" account. If you don't have one already,
   go to "Edit > Account Settings > Account Actions > Add Feed account...". This will add a new
   entry alongside your inbox.

   Right click on that entry and choose "Subscribe...", then write the above URL in the "Feed URL"
   edit box. Then press "Add".

*) And that's it! Now you will get an RSS feed from the arXiv without missing any article if you go
   traveling without internet connection for a week. Note that this setup will only work locally,
   one one computer. If you need to access this RSS feed from multiple computers, or if you wish
   to use a feed aggregator, you need to make the website public, and use the public address
   instead of "localhost" when registering to the feed. The filters will be shared among all
   computers, but each computer can have a different read history.

*) You can also edit the preferences.xml file to setup some filtering to reduce the amount of
   papers that appear in the RSS feed. See next section.


Customizing RSS feed
====================

Open the file:
    /home/<your_username>/.local/share/arxiv-transform/preferences.xml

This file controls, among other things, the various filters that can be applied to the arXiv
entries before they are sent to the RSS feed. Below is a description of all these options.

*) keep_history
This defines the amount of time a paper will remain in the RSS feed. Papers older than this will
be removed. You should set this amount of time to the longest time you may expect your computer to
be turned off (or without internet access). The syntax is that of the "date" command line tool, so
you can have "3 days ago" or "1 month ago". For example:
    <pref name="keep_history">2 weeks ago</pref>

*) star_include
This is a list of comma-separated words or expressions that will be searched for in each paper's
title and abstract. If at least one of these is found, the paper will appear with a little star in
its title in your RSS feed. These are case-insensitive. For example:
    <pref name="content_must_include">galaxy, main sequence, main-sequence, bulges</pref>

*) content_exclude
Same as above, except that a paper is deleted if any of these words or expressions is found in the
title or abstract.
    <pref name="content_must_include">chemistry, neutralino, comet</pref>

*) categories_must_include/categories_exclude
These two options work exactly the same as star_include and content_exclude, but will be applied
to the arXiv category string instead. The category string contains all the categories the paper
has been attributed to. There can be only one category (usually), or several if the paper has been
crossposted. For example:
    <pref name="categories_must_include">astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO</pref>
    <pref name="categories_exclude">gr-qc, astro-ph.SR</pref>
... will only display articles listed in astro-ph.GA or astro-ph.CO, and will exclude those that
are also listed in gr-qc and astro-ph.SR.

*) allow_crosspost
Set this to "0" to hide all entries that are listed in more than one arXiv category.

*) allow_replacements
Set this to "0" to only show papers when they appear on arXiv for the first time, and hide
announcements for updates and revisions.

*) only_accepted
Set this to "1" to only display the papers that contain the word "accepted" in their comment
field. The goal is to only list papers that are accepted for publication, rather than just
submitted. This option will take precedence over "allow_replacement", so you may see the same
paper appearing twice if the authors update the arXiv version multiple times after the paper
has been accepted.
